//  Write a program that asks the user to enter the monthly costs for the following expenses
//  incurred from operating his or her automobile: loan payment, insurance, gas, oil, tires,
//  and maintenance. The program should then display the total monthly cost of these
//  expenses, and the total amount of these expenses
